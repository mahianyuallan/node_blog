# Node Blog

A simple **Node.js blog application** built with **Express.js** and core Node modules.  
This project serves as a practical introduction to Node.js concepts such as:

- HTTP servers
- File system operations
- Express routing
- Middleware
- Streams
- Modules and exports

It is designed both as a learning resource and a lightweight blog skeleton that can be expanded into a full-featured web app.

## 🚀 Features

- **Express.js Routing**
  - `/` → Serves `index.html`
  - `/about` → Serves `about.html`
  - `/about-us` → Redirects to `/about`
  - 404 handler for unknown routes

- **Custom Node.js HTTP Server**
  - Serves static HTML files (`index`, `about`, `404`)
  - Handles redirects (`/about-me` → `/about`)
  - Uses `lodash` for utilities (`_.random`, `_.once`)

- **File System (fs) Operations**
  - Read and write text files
  - Create and remove directories
  - Delete files dynamically

- **Streams**
  - Readable and writable streams
  - Piping data between files

- **Modules**
  - Custom modules (`people.js`)
  - Built-in modules (`fs`, `os`)

- **Utility Scripts**
  - Demonstrates use of global objects, intervals, and exports
